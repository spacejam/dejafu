  -- * Bounded Partial-order Reduction

  -- | We can characterise the state of a concurrent computation by
  -- considering the ordering of dependent events. This is a partial
  -- order: independent events can be performed in any order without
  -- affecting the result, and so are /not/ ordered.
  --
  -- Partial-order reduction is a technique for computing these
  -- partial orders, and only testing one total order for each partial
  -- order. This cuts down the amount of work to be done
  -- significantly. /Bounded/ partial-order reduction is a further
  -- optimisation, which only considers schedules within some bound.
  --
  -- This module provides a combination pre-emption, fair, and length
  -- bounding runner:
  --
  -- * Pre-emption + fair bounding is useful for programs which use
  --   loop/yield control flows but are otherwise terminating.
  --
  -- * Pre-emption, fair + length bounding is useful for
  --   non-terminating programs, and used by the testing functionality
  --   in @Test.DejaFu@.
  --
  -- See /Bounded partial-order reduction/, K. Coons, M. Musuvathi,
  -- K. McKinley for more details.

  -- ** Pre-emption Bounding

  -- | BPOR using pre-emption bounding. This adds conservative
  -- backtracking points at the prior context switch whenever a
  -- non-conervative backtracking point is added, as alternative
  -- decisions can influence the reachability of different states.
  --
  -- See the BPOR paper for more details.

  , PreemptionBound(..)

  -- ** Fair Bounding

  -- | BPOR using fair bounding. This bounds the maximum difference
  -- between the number of yield operations different threads have
  -- performed.
  --
  -- See the BPOR paper for more details.

  , FairBound(..)

  -- ** Length Bounding

  -- | BPOR using length bounding. This bounds the maximum length (in
  -- terms of primitive actions) of an execution.

  , LengthBound(..)

  -- * Random Scheduling

  -- | By greatly sacrificing completeness, testing of a large
  -- concurrent system can be greatly sped-up. Counter-intuitively,
  -- random scheduling has better bug-finding behaviour than just
  -- executing a program \"for real\" many times. This is perhaps
  -- because a random scheduler is more chaotic than the real
  -- scheduler.
